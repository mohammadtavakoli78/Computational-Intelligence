## Introduction
This is projects of Computational Intelligence course. There are four projects.<br>
At first Project we should ```Classify Six Fruits``` with the help of ```Nueral Networks```.<br>
At second Project we should balance ```Inverted Pendulum``` with the help of ```Fuzzy System```.<br>
At third Project we should play a game name ```Snail Jumper``` with the help of ```Evolutionary Algorithms```.<br>
At fourth Project we should manage a ```Watering Plants System``` with the help of ```Fuzzy System```.<br>

## ðŸ’» First_Project
At this Project we should ```Classify Six Fruits``` with the help of ```Nueral Networks```. [Codes are in this link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Computational-Intelligence/tree/master/Project%201%20(Neural%20Networks%20-%20Classifying%20Fruits)).

## ðŸ’» Second_Project
At this Project we should balance ```Inverted Pendulum``` with the help of ```Fuzzy System```. [Codes are in this link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Computational-Intelligence/tree/master/Project%202%20(Fuzzy%20System%20-%20Inverted%20Pendulum)).

## ðŸ’» Third_Project
At this Project we should play a game name ```Snail Jumper``` with the help of ```Evolutionary Algorithms``` [Codes are in this link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Computational-Intelligence/tree/master/Project%203%20(Neuroevolution%20Game%20-%20SnailJ%20umper)).

## ðŸ’» Fourth_Project
At this Project we should manage a ```Watering Plants System``` with the help of ```Fuzzy System```. [Codes are in this link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Computational-Intelligence/tree/master/Project%204%20(Fuzzy%20System%20-%20Watering%20Plants)).
